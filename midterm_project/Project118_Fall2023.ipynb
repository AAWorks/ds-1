    "This is not a group project. You may discuss the project with other students but you should code and write the report independently. You should acknowledge any help in writing. The score will be based on:\n",
    "-  Clarity and soundness of the arguments and conclusions; \n",
    "-  Use of data to back up arguments and analysis quality;  \n",
    "-  Insightfulness of the results;\n",
    "-  Quality of the data vizualizations, summaries used, and overall presentation. Make sure you use headings, captions for figures and tables etc. When you interpret a graph or data from a table, you should clearly specify which figure/table you refer to.\n",

    "For this project, you are tasked to use the [National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/38090/summary). The NCVS gathers data about personal and household crimes since 1973. The primary goals of the survey are to collect information about the victims, to explore the consequences of crime, and to estimate the number and types of crimes that go unreported.\n",

Also provided on Canvas is a codebook (an Excel file containing information about each variable) created by your instructors as well as a codebook from the study itself giving additional information about the data and data collection methods that will be useful to answer some of the questions below. The preprocessed data provided has 8044 rows (first row is the name of the columns, and there are 8043 rows of data) and 81 columns. "

    "1. The Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code you use for the analysis. You do not need to submit data you used, but just indicate how you obtained it in the Notebook.\n",

    "2. A report of your findings **(in a .pdf file). This report should be at most 4 pages long including references.** Use data visualization and data summaries to justify your conclusions. Note that the page limitation means you will not show all analyses and plots you will make - select carefully what you think is most relevant.\n",

    "\n",
    "A.  **Introduce the dataset**.  Describe the data. Where does it come from? Why was it collected (what are the researchers interested in studying)? Was it an experiment? A retrospective observational study? A prospective observational study? Describe the sampling process. How many variables are there? List a few. How many observations (i.e., rows)? How many distinct households? Using what you have learned about data collection, is this a biased or unbiased sample? Why?\n",

    "The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), sponsored by the Bureau of Justice\n",
    "Statistics (BJS), is used to estimate the frequency and characteristics of criminal victimization in\n",
    "the United States. When calculating NCVS estimates, researchers must take into account the\n",
    "complex stratified, multistage sample design and resulting analysis weights. Stratification,\n",
    "clustering, and variation in analysis weights all affect the variances of survey parameters, and\n",
    "inappropriately accounting for these factors during estimation can lead to invalid results\n",
    "(Cochran, 1977).\n",
    "\n",
    "NCVS data, which are available in SAS, SPSS, Stata, R, and ASCII plain text formats, are organized in four files: an address-level file,1 a household-level file, a person-level file, and an incident-level file.2 Furthermore, since the NCVS employs a 6-month retroactive reference period for reporting crimes, data are available in two file structures: collection-year files and data-year files. Collection-year files contain incidents based on when the interviews were conducted (as opposed to when the incidents actually occurred). Data-year files contain incidents based on when they occurred, regardless of when the interviews were conducted. Different sets of survey weights are provided for each type of file. Under the collection-year approach, only 12 months of interviews are needed for annual estimation. With the data-year approach, annual estimates cannot be made until 18 months of interviews have been conducted, making collection-year-based estimation more timely. For most outcomes the difference between the collection-year and data-year estimates is not statistically or substantively different. Therefore, collection-year data are more commonly used in BJS analyses and reports. Although this user’s guide will introduce both collection- and data-year weights, the examples will focus on collection-year estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The household-level file contains one record per reporting period for each sampled household in the NCVS. It contains data from the household screening interview, which assesses whether a household experienced any property crimes during the previous 6 months. Additionally, the household-level file contains characteristics of the household’s surrounding area, such as the census region and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status, and the characteristics of the principal and reference persons within the household.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because households stay in the NCVS sample for 3 years—reporting seven times at 6-month intervals—most households appear on the annual household file more than once. For this reason, both the household identification number (IDHH) and the year and quarter indicator (YEARQ) must be used to uniquely identify households by reporting period when merging the household file with other NCVS data files. Household-level estimates for the collection  year use the collection-year household weight (WGTHHCY), whereas estimates for the data year are based on the data-year household weight (WGTHHDY). The household file is most commonly used in the calculation of property victimization rates.\n",
